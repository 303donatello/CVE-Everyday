However, in some cases, it is possible to construct a group using explicit parameters (instead of using a named curve). In those cases it is possible that such a group does not have the cofactor present. This can occur even where all the parameters match a known named curve. If such a curve is used then OpenSSL falls back to non-side channel resistant code paths which may result in full key recovery during an ECDSA signature operation. In order to be vulnerable an attacker would have to have the ability to time the creation of a large number of signatures where explicit parameters with no co-factor present are in use by an application using libcrypto. For the avoidance of doubt libssl is not vulnerable because explicit parameters are never used. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1d (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1c). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.0l (Affected 1.1.0-1.1.0k).

A partial mitigation for this issue is that the output from a high precision timer is mixed into the RNG state so the likelihood of a parent and child process sharing state is significantly reduced.

Subsequently, these credentials are processed in Teamviewer.exe, which allows any application running in the same non-administrative user context to intercept them in cleartext within process memory. By using this technique, a local attacker is able to obtain administrative credentials in order to elevate privileges. This vulnerability can be exploited by injecting code into Teamviewer.exe which intercepts calls to GetWindowTextW and logs the processed credentials.\n\n",
