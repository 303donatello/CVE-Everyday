At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this security vulnerability was known. Siemens confirms the security vulnerability and provides mitigations to resolve the security issue.\n\n",

Successful exploitation of the security vulnerability compromises confidentiality, integrity or availability of the targeted system. At the time of advisory publication no public exploitation of this security vulnerability was known.\n\n",
