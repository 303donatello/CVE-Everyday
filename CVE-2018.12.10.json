            "vul_detail": "An issue was discovered on KT MC01507L Z-Wave S0 devices. It occurs\nbecause HPKP is not implemented. The communication architecture is APP\n> Server > Controller (HUB) > Node (products which are controlled by\nHUB). The prerequisite is that the attacker is on the same network as\nthe target HUB, and can use IP Changer to change destination IP\naddresses (of all packets whose destination IP address is Server) to a\nproxy-server IP address. This allows sniffing of cleartext between\nServer and Controller. The cleartext command data is transmitted to\nController using the proxy server's fake certificate, and it is able to\ncontrol each Node of the HUB. Also, by operating HUB in Z-Wave Pairing\nMode, it is possible to obtain the Z-Wave network key.\n\n",

Next, the attacker\nconducts a DoS attack against the Z-Wave S0 Security version product by\ncontinuously sending divided \"Nonce Get (0x98 0x81)\" frames. The reason\nfor dividing the \"Nonce Get\" frame is that, in security version S0,\nwhen a node receives a \"Nonce Get\" frame, the node produces a random\nnew nonce and sends it to the Src node of the received \"Nonce Get\"\nframe. After the nonce value is generated and transmitted, the node\ntransitions to wait mode. At this time, when \"Nonce Get\" is received\nagain, the node discards the previous nonce value and generates a\nrandom nonce again. Therefore, because the frame is encrypted with\nprevious nonce value, the received normal frame cannot be decrypted.\n\n",
